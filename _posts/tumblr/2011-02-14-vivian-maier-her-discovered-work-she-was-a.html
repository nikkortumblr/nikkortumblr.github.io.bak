<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"She was a Socialist, a Feminist, a movie critic, and a tell-it-like-it-is type of person. She learned English by going to theaters, which she loved. She wore a men&#8217;s jacket, men&#8217;s shoes and a large hat most of the time. She was constantly taking pictures, which she didn&#8217;t show anyone."</span></span></p>
