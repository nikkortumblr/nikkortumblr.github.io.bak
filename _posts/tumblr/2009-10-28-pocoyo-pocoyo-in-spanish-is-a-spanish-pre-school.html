It is about a young boy dressed in blue, who is full of curiosity. Viewers are encouraged to recognise situations that Pocoyo is in, and things that are going on with or around him. Each character has its own distinctive dance, and most episodes end with the characters dancing. (via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocoyo">Pocoyo - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>)</p>
