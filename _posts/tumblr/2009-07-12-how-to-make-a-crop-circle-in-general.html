<p><b></b>In general, circlemakers use the following steps:</p>
<p>• Create a diagram of the design. Some circlemakers create the pattern spontaneously at the site.<br/> • Ropes and poles are used to measure out the circle.<br/> • One circlemaker stands in the middle of the circle, turning on one foot while pushing the crop down with the other to make a center.<br/> • The team makes the radius of the circle using a long rope tied at both ends to a 4 foot long (1.2 meter) board called a stalk stomper. One person stands at the center of the circle while the other walks around the edge of the circle, putting one foot in the middle of the board to stomp down the circle’s outline.</p>
