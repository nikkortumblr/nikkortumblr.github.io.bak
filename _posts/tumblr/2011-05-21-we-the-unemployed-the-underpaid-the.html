<p><span><em>We, the unemployed, the underpaid, the subcontracted, the precarious, the young â€¦ demand a change towards a future with dignity. We are fed up of reforms, of being laid off, of the banks which have caused the crisis hardening our mortgages or taking away our houses, of laws limiting our freedom in the interest of the powerful. We blame the political and economic powers of our sad situation and we call for a turn.</em></span></p>
