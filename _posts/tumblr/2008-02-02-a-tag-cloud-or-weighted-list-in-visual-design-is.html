title: A tag cloud (or weighted list in visual design) is a visual depiction of user-generated
  tags used typically to describe the content of web sites. Tags are usually single
  words and are typically listed alphabetically, and the importance of a tag is shown
  with font size or color. [1] Thus both finding a tag by alphabet and by popularity
  is possible. The tags are usually hyperlinks that lead to a collection of items
  that are associated with a tag.
