Some of the last packs were alright, but did not bring as much to the table as I had hoped. The Tintype SnapPak, in my opinion being the strongest release in a bit. I was similarly a bit disappointed in the São Paulo Hipstapak. I will say the Robusta film offers interesting effects. For example in the image I took here on the beach near Chicago last night. Used in combination with other lenses, the Robusta film can inflect an image in interesting ways. I liked how it paired with Hornbecker, and Tinto 1884. The Madalena lens is probably not one I will use very much. I feel in early experiments that it overpowers the effect and intention of whatever film I pair it with. I feel it dulled the entire images, reducing its integrity. Why keep a dulled image? I am still of mixed feelings about the pak, especially with a name that suggests bright, bold color effects. Perhaps I would have called this the Reykjavik Pak?"</p>
