<p>Photographer, writer, publisher, and curator <b>Alfred Stieglitz</b> (1864-1946) was a visionary, far ahead of his time. Around the turn of the 20th century he founded the <b>Photo-Secession, a progressive movement</b> concerned with advancing the creative possibilities of photography, and by 1903 began publishing Camera Work, an <b>avant-garde magazine</b> devoted to voicing the ideas, both in images and words, of the Photo-Secession. Camera Work was the first photo journal whose focus was visual, rather than technical, and its illustrations were of the highest quality hand-pulled photogravure printed on Japanese tissue. This book brings together <b>a broad selection from the journalâ€™s 50 issues</b>.
