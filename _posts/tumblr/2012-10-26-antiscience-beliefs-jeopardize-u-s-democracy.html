<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=antiscience-beliefs-jeopardize-us-democracy">Antiscience Beliefs Jeopardize U.S. Democracy: Scientific American</a><br/><p>A large number of major party contenders for political office this year took antiscience positions against evolution, human-induced climate change, vaccines, stem cell research, and more.<br/>
Such positions are surprising because the economy is such a big factor in this election, and half the economic growth since World War II can be traced to innovations in science and technology.<br/>
Partisans at both ends of the political spectrum have been guilty of science denialism. But the Republican version is particularly dangerous because it attacks the validity of science itself.<br/>
U.S. voters must push candidates and elected officials to express their views on the major science questions facing the nation or risk losing out to those countries with reality-based policies.</p>
