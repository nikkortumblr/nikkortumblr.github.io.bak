The German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) has suspended the registration for eight pesticide seed treatment products used in rapeseed oil and sweetcorn. The move follows reports from German beekeepers in the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg region that two thirds of their bees died earlier this month following the application of a pesticide called clothianidin.&#8221;It&#8217;s a real bee emergency,&#8221; said Manfred Hederer, president of the German Professional Beekeepers&#8217; Association. &#8220;50-60% of the bees have died on average and some beekeepers have lost all their hives.&#8221; (via <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/23/wildlife.endangeredspecies">Pesticides: Germany bans chemicals linked to honeybee devastation | Environment | guardian.co.uk</a>)</p>
