<img src="/tumblr_files/069MD6LsD8iq5agla2lzNdi5_400.jpg"/><br/><p>Processing is an open source programming language and environment for people who want to program images, animation, and interactions. It is used by students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists for learning, prototyping, and production. It is created to teach fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context and to serve as a software sketchbook and professional production tool. Processing is developed by artists and designers as an alternative to proprietary software tools in the same domain.<br/><br/>Processing is free to download and available for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Please help to release the next version!<br/><br/>Processing is an open project initiated by Ben Fry and Casey Reas. It evolved from ideas explored in the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab.  </p>
