<p><b>Jean Shrimpton</b> met photographer <b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0047222" title="David Bailey (photographer)" rel="imdb" class="zem_slink">David Bailey</a></b> on a shoot for a cornflakes advertisement. His friend told him she was too posh for him, but Bailey thought &#8216;we&#8217;ll see about that!&#8217; The couple had a relationship for four years.<br/><br/>In 1965 she arrived for the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup">Melbourne Cup</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Davis_Cup_team" title="Australia Davis Cup team" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">Australia</a></b> and shocked everybody by wearing a plain white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress" title="Dress" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">shift dress</a> which ended at least 10&#160;cm above her knees. To make things worse she wore no hat, stockings or gloves. This was very controversial at the time, but Jean was blissfully unaware of the riot she caused.</p>
