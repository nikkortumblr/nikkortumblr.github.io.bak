title: For his seminal book, “The Americans“, Robert Frank shot 767 rolls of film
  which yielded about 27,000 images. Frank edited that down to about 1,000 work prints,
  spread them across the floor of his studio to first glimpse at them. Over time he
  started tacking the ones he liked most to his walls for a final edit. After a year
  and a half of work in his project, Frank chose just 83 images for his entire book
  (83/27,000=.3%). Only .3% of the shots of the photographs Frank shot in total made
  it into his book.
