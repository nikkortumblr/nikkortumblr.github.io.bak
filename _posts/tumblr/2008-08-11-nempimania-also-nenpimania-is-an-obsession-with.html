  possible from a hybrid car. It is derived from the Japanese “nempi” (燃費)—a contraction
  of nenryōshōhiryō （燃料消費量）[4] meaning fuel economy, and mania, meaning “craze for.”
  Nempimania is exhibited by owners of the Toyota Prius and other hybrid owners by
  various habits aimed at maximizing fuel economy: slow starts, “Pulse and Glide”,
  timing stoplights, driving barefoot[citation needed], etc.'
