As early as 1902 Marcel Duchamp was painting in the garden of the family home. A pioneer of Dadaism and Surrealism, Duchamp was equally passionate about chess. In 1923 he concentrated on playing and his strength became near master class. He played in the French Championships and also in the Olympiads 1928-1933. In 1925 he had his chances to become the French chess champion of France. He started well in the tournament, but blundered in a winning position against the eventual victor Robert Crepeaux, and then, perhaps deflated, lost to Casier. Duchamp ended up sixth.
