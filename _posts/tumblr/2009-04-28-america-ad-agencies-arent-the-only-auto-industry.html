Reuters reports that a Spanish Citroen ad has triggered quite a furor in China. The poster shows Chairman Mao looking down at a Citroen hatchback. The copy proclaims, &#8220;It&#8217;s true, we are leaders, but at Citroen the revolution never stops. We are once more going to put in motion all the machinery of our technological ability, in order to repeat in 2008 the successes obtained in previous years.&#8221; The picture of Mao is similar to one in Tianamen Square, with the the People&#8217;s Republic founder&#8217;s mouth distorted and squinting eyes. Once the ad hit the internet, the shit hit the fan. Chinese web slingers felt the ad was &#8220;not only insulting [to] Chairman Mao, but the whole Chinese nation… where Mao is greatly revered.&#8221; Citroen immediately pulled the ad and issued an apology. What effect the faux pas will have on Citroen&#8217;s Chinese sales remains to be seen.</p>
