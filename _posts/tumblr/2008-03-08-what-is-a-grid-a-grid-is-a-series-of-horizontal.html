(A ‘page’ does not have to be a printed page. Grids are used in a website design and computer-based applications.) Grids can be derived solely by mathematics, allowing equations and ratios to determine proportion, or a combination of simple division of the overall page dimensions customized for solving the problem at hand.

A grid can consist of a single column framed by margins, or it may have multiple columns and rows.
