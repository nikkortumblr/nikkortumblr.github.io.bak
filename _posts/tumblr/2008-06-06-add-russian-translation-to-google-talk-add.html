<ul><li>Add XX2YY@bot.talk.google.com to your buddylist. XX will be your language such as EN(which stands for English) and YY is the language you wish to translate to such as RU(which is Russian)<br/></li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>Send the phrase you wish to translate to that person and almost instantly you will get a response back with your translation!<br/></li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>You can even start a group chat and add multiple translation bots to it to get your phrases translated in many languages at the same time!</li>
</ul><p>Examples:</p>
<ul><li>en2ru@bot.talk.google.com (English to Russian)<br/></li>
<li>ru2en@bot.talk.google.com (Russian to English)<br/></li>
