title: I used to be a hardcore Firefox user, I also used to hate older verisons of
  Opera. A year back I gave the newest Opera build a chance and it was fantastic.
  It has more features than Firefox, while running quicker and lighter. Overall, I
  just kind of got sick of Firefox’s bulkiness, that was the greatness of Firefox,
  it was slim, efficent, and open source. Opera has taken it’s place as my browser
  of choice, for the power user I have to say it is hands down the best option. Everyone
  has their own preference, but overall it has grown vastly in the last few upgrades
  to get even better, while Firefox is just kind of standing still.
