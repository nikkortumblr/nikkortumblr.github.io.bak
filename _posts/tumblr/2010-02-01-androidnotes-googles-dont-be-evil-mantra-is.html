<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/01/googles-dont-be-evil-mantra-is-bullshit-adobe-is-lazy-apples-steve-jobs/">Google’s ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Mantra is ‘Bullshit,’ Adobe Is Lazy: Apple’s Steve Jobs (Update 2) | Epicenter | Wired.com</a></p>
<p>On Google: We did not enter the search business, Jobs said. They entered the phone business. Make no mistake they want to kill the iPhone. We won’t let them, he says. Someone else asks something on a different topic, but there’s no getting Jobs off this rant. I want to go back to that other question first and say one more thing, he says. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">don’t be evil</a> mantra: “It’s bullshit.” Audience roars.</p>
<p>About Adobe: They are lazy, Jobs says. They have all this potential to do interesting things but they just refuse to do it. They don’t do anything with the approaches that Apple is taking, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_%28API%29">Carbon</a>. Apple does not support Flash because it is so buggy, he says. Whenever a Mac crashes more often than not it’s because of Flash. No one will be using Flash, he says. <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/03/apple-shows-off/">The world is moving to HTML5</a>.</p>
