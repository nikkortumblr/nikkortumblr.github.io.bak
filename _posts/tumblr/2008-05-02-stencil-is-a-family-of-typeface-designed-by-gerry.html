Consists of only capital letters with rounded edges and thick main strokes, it recreates the stenciled alphabet used on boxes and crates. Two stencil typefaces were released in 1937 within a month of each other, one was designed for American Type Founders. That version became known as <a href="http://www.linotype.com/12634/stencilbold-font.html">Stencil Bold</a>.  </p>
