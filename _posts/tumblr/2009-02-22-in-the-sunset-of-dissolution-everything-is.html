<blockquote>In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine.</blockquote>&#8212;The novel &#8220;Everything Is Illuminated&#8221; by Jonathan Safran Foer takes its title from a quote in Milan Kundera&#8217;s novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being. The passage refers to the philosophical idea that the greatest tragedies in life can only be experienced to their fullest if we are able to relive them.
