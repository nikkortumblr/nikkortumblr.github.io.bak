These albums paint in great detail the family and social life which so engrossed the photographer down the decades of the 20th Century. His wealthy background allowed him untrammelled access to his twin obsessions, beautiful women and movement, often combined in the one shot. From his first photograph at the age of six (camera and tuition provided by his father) Lartigue was intrigued by the notion of capturing the moment. Thus an extensive series of shots of family members jumping off walls and down steps, occasionally appearing to fly. This fascination with movement and speed would have its apogee inhis photograph taken at the ACF Grand Prix in 1912. All this frantic excitement of speed was played out against a background of uninterrupted leisure, a life of considerable privilege. For decades Lartigue followed and documented the season as it passed from Biarritz to Chamonix, portraying changing fashions on the boulevards, promenades and, as here, at the race course.The Great War is observed from a distance and the World War II is ignored as far as possible, though the liberation of Paris features briefly. In the war&#8217;s aftermath, with the comfortable certainties of his social milieu all but vanished, Lartigue turned to other subjects for inspiration, with mixed results. He would photograph for another four decades but the world he knew best was gone for good.
