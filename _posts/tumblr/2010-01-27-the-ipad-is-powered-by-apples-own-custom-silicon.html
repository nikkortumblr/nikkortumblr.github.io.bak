<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_kwx6u2JSTv1qz8s2xo1_500.png"/><br/><p>The iPad is powered by Apple’s own custom silicon, he says — a 1&#160;GHz  A4 chip&#8222; 16&#160;GB of memory, 32 or 64 Gigabytes of storage.</p>
<p>There’s Wi-Fi, 802.11n, and the latest Bluetooth. (Apparently no 3G  wireless, notes my colleague John Markoff.) Accelerometer, compass,  speaker, microphone.</p>
