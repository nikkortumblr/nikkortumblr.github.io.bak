My answer: you can describe it. In this sense I feel the images below by Antoine D&#8217;AGATA, as presented in threes and fours here on the web (they may well not have originally been intended to display this way, and I know there are many more from the series ) do exactly that. When finally one tires of scientifically defining life (who knows we may at last come to know this is impossible), and projecting its future (we already know the universal answer to that) all that is left that works for me is visual poetry, and these photos are bitter-sweet poetry. The series &#8220;Mala Noche&#8221; shows life in the Mexican slums. (via <a href="http://www.1mag3.co.uk/articles/84">Mala Noche - by Antoine D&#8217;AGATA | 1mag3)</a></p>
