<img src="/tumblr_files/069MD6LsD6sl0smqVn71ANTf_500.jpg"/><br/><p>This is the Ica model #1! It is a bare bones dirt-cheap box-type entry level camera for the format of 4.5x6cm, vertically oriented, a format considered &#8220;miniature&#8221; in this time. Still, it was three times larger than our &#8220;modern&#8221; 35mm film format! (via <a href="http://ludens.cl/photo/ica/camera.html">Ica cameras of 1913</a>) </p>
