<p>The name Sarah Moon has an almost mythic tone in the world of photography. &#8220;Photography is the spirit of all moments that a person has seen simply disappear.&#8221;</p>
<p>After completing studies in history, Sarah Moon made a living modelling haute couture. A self-taught photographer, she spontaneously tapped the technical possibilities and craft of photography, and in 1968 she began to devote herself to advertising work as a freelance photographer. In her personal creative work as well as in her commercial work, Sarah Moon has achieved an unmistakeable intimate pictorial style which lies outside of any specific category or genre and which has a great poetic strength. The name Sarah Moon has an almost mythic tone in the world of photography. In her often mysterious photographs she captures a sense of history and at the same time she invites the viewer to inquire into the future of the magical moment. &#8220;The only way I can recuperate my vision of reality is to steal it. It is a method of proving strength, in which the goal isnÂ´t to win, but merely to become better able to see.&#8221; (via <a href="http://www.lgp.cz/en/pr/sarah-moon-circuss-7-5-31-5-2008/">Leica Gallery Praha - Sarah Moon Circuss 7.5.-31.5.2008</a>)</p>
