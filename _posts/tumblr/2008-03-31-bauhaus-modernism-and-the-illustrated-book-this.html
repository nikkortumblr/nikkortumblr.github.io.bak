Distinguished book designer and author Alan Bartram examines work by such key figures as Max Bill, F. T. Marinetti, El Lissitzky, László Moholy-Nagy, Jan Tschichold, and Paul Rand. All of the carefully chosen examples–some of which have not been previouslyreproduced–clearly demonstrate the modernist revolution that took place in graphic design. In an informative introductory essay, Bartram surveys the German art and design school known as the Bauhaus. Under Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus intended to create an academic, theoretical, and practical synthesis of all forms of visual expression–a marrying of art, architecture, industry, and design that had never been attempted before. Although the Bauhaus existed for only fourteen years, from 1920 to 1934, Bartram asserts that its philosophy influenced the appearance of almost every kind of modernist artifact throughout the twentieth century and continues to do so today. Engagingly written and handsomely illustrated, this volume is a valuable resource for designers and book lovers everywhere.
