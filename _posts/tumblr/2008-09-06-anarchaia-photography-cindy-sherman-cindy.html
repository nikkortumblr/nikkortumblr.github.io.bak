<p><b>Cindy Sherman</b><br/> Untitled Film Still #50<br/>1979</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cindy Sherman began her now famous series <i>Untitled Film Stills</i> twenty years ago at the end of 1977. Those small black-and-white photographs of Sherman spoke to a generation of baby boomer women who had grown up absorbing those glamorous images at home on their televisions, taking such portrayals as cues for their future.</p>
