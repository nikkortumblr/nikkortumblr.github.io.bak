<p>- &#8220;So What&#8221; voicing: major third on top, quartal stack below<br/><br/>- &#8220;Kenny Barron&#8221; m11 voicing: two perfect 5ths in each hand, separated by minor second (1-5-9-b3-7-11)<br/><br/>- &#8220;Killer Joe&#8221; dom7 voicing: 7-3-13-9-5-1<br/><br/>- &#8220;Bud Powell&#8221; voicings: 1-7, 1-3&#160;<br/><br/>- &#8220;Bill Evans&#8221; voicings: seems like this is sometimes loosely used to refer to the typical LH voicings with 3 or 7 on the bottom (aka the &#8220;A position&#8221; and &#8220;B position&#8221; voicings)<br/><br/>- &#8220;Frank Mantooth&#8221; voicings (there are several in his Voicings book; mostly pure quartal stacks, &#8220;So What&#8221; voicings, or upper-structure RH triads over a dom7 LH shell; I&#8217;m not sure which of these the phrase &#8220;Mantooth voicing&#8221; really is intended to refer to)<br/><br/>- McCoy Tyner&#8217;s name is often associated with quartal stacks.</p>
