<p>Email users opting to use Google&#8217;s Gmail email service were thrown into a panic as the service went down on Tuesday. &#8220;Gmail down, PANIC STATIONS, PANIC STATIONS. Or I could go and make a cuppa, I suppose&#8221;, summed up the cries on Twitter as users looked at communicating with people in other ways. &#8220;We aren&#8217;t sure what the problem is. Our engineers are working on it,&#8221; a spokesman for Google told Pocket-lint. The service went down at around 10:20am GMT and as yet has failed to come back online however users have reported that they are still able to access email via their desktop inboxes and phones suggesting the problem is related to just the website.
