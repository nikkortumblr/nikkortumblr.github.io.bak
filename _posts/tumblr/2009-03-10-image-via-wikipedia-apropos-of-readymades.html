<p><b>"Apropos of &#8216;Readymades&#8217;" - Marcel Duchamp</b></p>
<p><br/>In 1913 I had the happy idea to fasten a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and watch it turn.<br/>A few months later I bought a cheap reproduction of a winter evening landscape, which I called &#8220;Pharmacy&#8221; after adding two small dots, one red and one yellow, in the horizon.<br/>In New York in 1915 I bought at a hardware store a snow shovel on which I wrote &#8220;In advance of the broken arm.&#8221;<br/>It was around that time that the word &#8220;Readymade&#8221; came to my mind to designate this form of manifestation.<br/>A point that I want very much to establish is that the choice of these &#8220;Readymades&#8221; was never dictated by aesthetic delectation.<br/>The choice was based on a reaction of visual indifference with at the same time a total absence of good or bad taste &#8230; in fact a complete anaesthesia.<br/>One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the &#8220;Readymade.&#8221;<br/>That sentence instead of describing the object like a title was meant to carry the mind of the spectator towards other regions more verbal.<br/>Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which, in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called &#8220;Readymade aided.&#8221;<br/>At another time, wanting to expose the basic antinomy between art and &#8220;Readymades,&#8221; I imagined a &#8220;Reciprocal Readymade&#8221;: use a Rembrandt as an ironing board!<br/>I realized very soon the danger of repeating indiscriminately this form of expression and decided to limit the production of &#8220;Readymades&#8221; to a small number yearly. I was aware at that time, that for the spectator even more for the artist, art is a habit forming drug and I wanted to protect my &#8220;Readymades&#8221; against such a contamination.<br/>Another aspect of the &#8220;Readymade&#8221; is its lack of uniqueness&#8230; the replica of the &#8220;Readymade&#8221; delivering the same message, in fact nearly every one of the &#8220;Readymades&#8221; existing today is not an original in the conventional sense.<br/>A final remark to this egomaniac&#8217;s discourse:<br/>Since the tubes of paint used by an artist are manufactured and readymade products we must conclude that all the paintings in the world are &#8220;Readymades aided&#8221; and also works of assemblage.<br/><br/>Written in 1961</p>
