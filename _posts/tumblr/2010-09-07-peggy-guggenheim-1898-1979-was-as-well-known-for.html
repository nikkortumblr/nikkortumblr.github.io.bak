To mention a few highlights of her illustrious history, she was a central figure in the Paris art world from 1922 onwards. Her circle of friends included writers and avant-garde artists.  The photo below was taken in 1924 by the experimental artist Man Ray, who is now known as a quintessential figure of photography.</p>
