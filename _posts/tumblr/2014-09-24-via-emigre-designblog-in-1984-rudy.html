<p>In 1984 Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko launched a type company named Emigre, based in Northern California, making it the first contemporary type foundry to sell original fonts made on and created for the computer. In addition to designing and licensing over 300 typefaces by a wide range of designers, Emigre also published a magazine for 21 years that published criticism and essays on  graphic design while providing a beautiful showcase for Emigreâ€™s fonts.</p>
