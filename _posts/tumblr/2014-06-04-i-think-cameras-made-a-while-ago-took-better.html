  I think cameras made a while ago, took better pictures, film was a better medium for capturing light than a digital sensor, and optics where generally made better the further back you go.
  I am by no means a hugely retrospective person, i have a DLSR and an iPhone and accept that technology will continue to make our lives easier and easier, however, when it comes to photography, i find the more control i have over the hardware, and the older the hardware is, quite simply, the better the picture.
  As i am also a fairly technically minded, I work for Leica in London as a camera Technician, and don’t own to many things I haven’t taken apart at some stage, I thought I could offer an opinion in the form of individual reviews that might well be useful to some people.
