If a camera captures six stops of dynamic range, half of the 4,096 levels are devoted to the brightest stop, half of the remainder (1,024 levels) are devoted to the next stop, half of the remainder (512 levels) are devoted to the next stop, and so on. The darkest stop, the extreme shadows, is represented by only 64 levels—as shown above. </p><p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/linear_gamma.pdf">Raw Capture, Linear Gamma, and Exposure</a><br/>(<a href="http://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/linear_gamma.pdf">download</a>)</p>
