<p>Notes on ATELIERS D&#8217; ARTISTE <br/><br/> As an assistant to Irving Penn and Helmut Newton in the &#8217;70s, Mark Arbeit learned the most important lesson of his career: &#8220;&#8221;Light is photography,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Newton taught me never be afraid to shoot in low light &#8212; it could create something unexpected.&#8221; From Penn, he learned the art of indirect light. For a photographer obsessed with natural light, the atelier is a sort of holy grail. &#8220;The idea is almost 200 years old,&#8221; says Arbeit. &#8220;It&#8217;s a studio designed so a sculptor or painter can work with consistent light.&#8221; The sun traveling east to west never changes this indirect light. &#8220;Penn gave me the idea to use this space for photography.&#8221; <br/><br/>Arbeit chose to bring the female nude back to the atelier. &#8220;This natural light draws the human form so well,&#8221; he explains. On first glance the women appear to be posing for the work around them, as if Arbeit interrupted an artist at work; closer inspection reveals the women to be mimicking the portraits and sculptures they&#8217;re surrounded by. &#8220;I want to create a balance and harmony between the model and the room, one not overpowering the other.&#8221; Thus, each model is a chameleon, whether perched as a sculpture on a pedestal, or literally wrapped in an artist&#8217;s canvas. She&#8217;s a muse after the fact &#8212; call it still life imitating art.</p>
