<a href="https://drupal.org/project/paragraphs">Paragraphs | Drupal.org</a><br/><p>Paragraphs is the new way of content creation! Instead of putting all your content in one WYSIWYG body field, your content will exist of a paragraph field containing multiple paragraph items. Paragraph items can contain multiple fields and have different types of field sets(bundles), which makes your content extremely flexible!</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>Add a slideshow between blocks of text<br/>
Add a youtube embed between your text<br/>
Add quotes between your content blocks<br/>
Check the images on the right to see the resulting node form.</p>
