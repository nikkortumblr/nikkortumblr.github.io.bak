<img src="/tumblr_files/069MD6LsDklru7xduoCQfbht.jpg"/><br/><p><b>New typography</b> is defined as a rejection of classical rules of typography and symmetry. <b>Lissitzky</b> traced the roots of <b>New Typography</b> back to <b>Marinetti</b>’s futurist poetry, in an essay he wrote in 1927. Lissitzky’s typography was the first forma; application to this new approach of type – sans serif letterforms, with a limited range of color, and geometric forms. Lissitzky is given credit as being the first to absorb the lessons of the modern art movements and successfully apply them to communications. <b>Moholy-Nagy</b> adapted Lissitzky’s basic ideas and applied them to the <b>Bauhaus</b> course.
