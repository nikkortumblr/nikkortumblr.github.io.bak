<p>Google Docs can now perform OCR on digital images. You can upload an image containing typewritten or printed text (like a fax document or a scanned newspaper clipping) to your Google Docs account and it will turn that image into editable text.</p>
<p>The OCR feature in Google Docs is not part of the standard UI yet but you can use this <a href="http://googlecodesamples.com/docs/php/ocr.php">sample form</a> to upload scanned images to your Google Account and the server will automatically try to extract text from these images provided the image resolution is good and that the text inside images is written using Latin character sets.</p>
