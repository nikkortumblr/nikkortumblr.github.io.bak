The first, <b>"The Family of Man,"</b> showcased an exhibition put together for the Museum of Modern Art by its photography curator, Edward Steichen. That book wound up—or so it seemed at the time—on every other middle-class coffee table in the country. The other, much smaller book presented 83 images by a little-known Swiss émigré named Robert Frank. In its first year of publication in the United States, <b>"The Americans"</b> sold only 600 copies, and what reviews it received were mostly awful. But in the decades since, it&#8217;s &#8220;The Americans&#8221; that has triumphed. Today &#8220;The Family of Man&#8221; is dismissed by most critics as a well-meant but overorchestrated attempt to show our common humanity through images of various cultures eating, dancing, singing, etc. &#8220;The Americans,&#8221; in contrast, was a dark, brooding book that made no attempt at evenhandedness. Yet today, 50 years after it was first published, it is &#8220;The Americans&#8221; that looks fresh every time we open it. Literature, Ezra Pound said, is &#8220;news that stays news.&#8221; You could say the same about &#8220;The Americans.&#8221; (via <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/138381">Photography: Robert Frank&#8217;s &#8216;The Americans&#8217; at 50 | Newsweek Arts Extra | Newsweek.com</a>)</p>
