What are the ten most interesting numbers? Jam-packed with thought-provoking mathematical mysteries, puzzles, and games, Wonders of Numbers will enchant even the most left-brained of readers. Hosted by the quirky Dr. Googol&#8212;who resides on a remote island and occasionally collaborates with Clifford Pickover&#8212;Wonders of Numbers focuses on creativity and the delight of discovery. Here is a potpourri of common and unusual number theory problems of varying difficulty&#8212;each presented in brief chapters that convey to readers the essence of the problem rather than its extraneous history. Peppered throughout with illustrations that clarify the problems, Wonders of Numbers also includes fascinating &#8220;math gossip.&#8221; How would we use numbers to communicate with aliens? Check out Chapter 30. Did you know that there is a Numerical Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder? You&#8217;ll find it in Chapter 45. From the beautiful formula of India&#8217;s most famous mathematician to the Leviathan number so big it makes a trillion look small, Dr. Googol&#8217;s witty and straightforward approach to numbers will entice students, educators, and scientists alike to pick up a pencil and work a problem.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonders-Numbers-Adventures-Mathematics-Meaning/dp/0195157990">(amazon)</a></p>
