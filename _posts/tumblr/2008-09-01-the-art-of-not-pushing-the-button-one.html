<p>One difference between photography and painting (or drawing, or other forms of art) is that it takes no talent, and practically no effort, to get an image on film. A modern camera - as the one we are using right now - takes care even of focusing and exposure. All my efforts are spent in holding back, in telling myself: &#8220;No, this is not yet the best light for Alexandra, not yet her most photogenic angle, not yet her truest expression.&#8221; The reason for holding back is not only to spare some film - it&#8217;s like storing my energy, or rather my expectation; it&#8217;s letting the image I want take shape in my mind, by the very act of refusing the images I don&#8217;t want. Until the moment when I recognize, in the viewfinder, the image that I want to see - and then there is no holding back any more.</p>
