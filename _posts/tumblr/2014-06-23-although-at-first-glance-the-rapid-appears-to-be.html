The shutter button, located on the user’s right hand side of the pleasantly bright viewfinder, has threading for some sort of remote release cable, and is balanced by a flash sync socket located on the other side of the camera. On the bottom of the front plate are three switches. Although I’m not entirely sure what the letters stand for (possibly something in German), flipping the “T” or “N” switch allows you to choose between two aperture settings (“T” is approximately f/16 while “N” is roughly f/8). Toggling the middle switch from “O” to “G” (which may stand for gelb, the German word for “yellow”) activates a built-in yellow filter. The last switch controls the shutter speed: “M” for a fixed shutter speed of approximately 1/60 seconds and “Z” (which may stand for zeit, the German word for “time”) puts the shutter in Bulb mode.
