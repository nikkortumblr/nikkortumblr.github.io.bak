Not necessarily. I emailed the Times article to my friend who’s actually read Karl Marx, and here’s what he had to say: But when you view it ala Marx, it makes perfect sense. To him, all art is propaganda. And propaganda is simply anything that promotes a point of view. The Soviets were using their propaganda to promote nationalism; marketers are using the same images to promote consumerism, by simply making small changes (prettier models, having the lines move towards products). It’s still a “Join our bandwagon” message. (via <a href="http://collectiveselection.com/?cat=38">collective selection&#160;» Fashion as Code</a>)</p>
