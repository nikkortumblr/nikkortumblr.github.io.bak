<p>Sensors are often referred to with a &#8220;type&#8221; designation using imperial fractions such as 1/1.8&#8221; or 2/3&#8221; which are larger than the actual sensor diameters. The type designation harks back to a set of standard sizes given to TV camera tubes in the 50&#8217;s. These sizes were typically 1/2&#8221;, 2/3&#8221; etc. The size designation does not define the diagonal of the sensor area but rather the outer diameter of the long glass envelope of the tube. Engineers soon discovered that for various reasons the usable area of this imaging plane was approximately two thirds of the designated size. This designation has clearly stuck (although it should have been thrown out long ago). There appears to be no specific mathematical relationship between the diameter of the imaging circle and the sensor size, although it is always roughly two thirds.</p>
