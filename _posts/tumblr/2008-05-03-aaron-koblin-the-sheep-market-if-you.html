Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me: <br/>‘That doesn&#8217;t matter. Draw me a sheep &#8230;’”<br/><br/>-Le Petit Prince </p>
