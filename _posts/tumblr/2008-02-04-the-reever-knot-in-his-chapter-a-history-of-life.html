<p>In his chapter A History of Life Support Knots in The History and Science of Knots (J C Turner and P van de Griend, World Scientific, 1996), Charles Warner draws attention to a paper Knots for Climbers by C E I Wright and J E Magowan which appeared in volume 40 of the Alpine Journal in 1928. One of the bends featured in this paper, and recommended for joining two ropes, is described as the Reever Knot.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.enm.bris.ac.uk/staff/rrc/knots/Reever.pdf">http://www.enm.bris.ac.uk/staff/rrc/knots/Reever.pdf</a></p>
