An entire film about a font. It’s absolutely wonderful. The film tells three stories at once: The history of typography since the 50s The history of design since the 50s and The history of Western culture since the 50s (via <a href="http://drawn.ca/2008/02/09/helvetica-the-documentary-film/"> Helvetica: The Documentary Film&#160;» Drawn!
