<img src="/tumblr_files/069MD6LsD65pc8uwzqesQLrK_500.png"/><br/><p>A reconstruction of <a href="http://creativetechnology.salford.ac.uk/fuchs/modules/input_output/Cage_Duchamp/duchamp_rotoreliefs.htm">Duchamp’s Rotoreliefs</a> using text. They are meant as an homage to Duchamp. A linguistic analysis of any of the spirals will show various ambiguities in terms of meaning or phonetics. These sentences may really wring a scientific brain. There is no end.</p>
