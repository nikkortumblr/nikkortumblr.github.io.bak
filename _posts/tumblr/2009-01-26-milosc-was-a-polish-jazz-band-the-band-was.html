The band was founded in 1988 by Ryszard Tymon Tymański, double bassist and guitarist, former leader of new-wave group Sni Sredstwom Za Uklanianie. Miłość played free jazz with avantgarde influences, and gave birth, among other Tricity and Bydgoszcz jazz bands, to new style called yass. Band splitted up after Olter&#8217;s tragic death in 2002.
