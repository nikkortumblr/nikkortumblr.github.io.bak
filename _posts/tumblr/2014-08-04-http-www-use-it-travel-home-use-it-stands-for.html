<p>USE-IT stands for no-nonsense tourist info for young people. USE-IT guides, maps, and websites are made by young locals, are not commercial, free, and up-to-date. Some USE-IT&#8217;s also have a visitors desk, mostly run by volunteers. Every USE-IT publishes maps or guides that will guide you through the city in a no-nonsense way.
