<p>The old Raketa caliber 2609 was a beautful, classically constructed  mens&#8217; size movement.</p>
<p>It contained a directly driven center second hand and also a directly  driven center minute indication. The real speciality of that movement is the  gold-toned screw balance with its breguet-type hairspring.</p>
<p>This detail was outside russia very expensive and only used in high-end  watches and allows very good timing results.</p>
