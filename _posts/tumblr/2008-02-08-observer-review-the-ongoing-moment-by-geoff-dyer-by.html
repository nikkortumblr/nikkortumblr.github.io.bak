This offering, which is ambitious in its scale - 42 photographers are discussed, from the early 1800s to the present day - roams freely across decades, forms and subjects without losing its unifying thrust. Curator John Szarkowski once said of Garry Winogrand&#8217;s photographs that they &#8216;were not illustrations of what we had known, but were new knowledge&#8217;, and it is this &#8216;new knowledge&#8217; that Dyer sets out to decode in his inimitable way.</p>
