There is no substitute. Gary Winogrand was all about the shooting. When he died of cancer at the age of just 56, he left behind 2500 undeveloped rolls of 36-exposure 35mm film (mostly Tri-X), 6,500 rolls of developed, but not contact-printed film and another 300 apparently untouched, unedited contact sheets. Thatâ€™s a staggering number of images shot.
