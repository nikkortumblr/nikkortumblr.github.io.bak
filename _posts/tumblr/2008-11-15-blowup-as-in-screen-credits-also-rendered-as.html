It tells the story of a photographer&#8217;s involvement with a murder case. The film was inspired by the short story &#8220;Las Babas del Diablo&#8221; (&#8220;The Droolings of the Devil&#8221;) by Argentinian writer <a class="zem_slink" rel="wikipedia" title="Julio Cortázar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Cort%C3%A1zar">Julio Cortázar</a>, and by the work, habits, and mannerisms of Swinging London photographer <a class="zem_slink" rel="wikipedia" title="David Bailey (photographer)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bailey_%28photographer%29">David Bailey</a>. The film was scored by jazz pianist <a class="zem_slink" rel="wikipedia" title="Herbie Hancock" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbie_Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>, although the music is diegetic as it is played on a record by the main character. Though nominated for several awards, it failed to win anything but the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival.
