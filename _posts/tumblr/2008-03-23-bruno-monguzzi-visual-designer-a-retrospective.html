Monguzzi is probably better known abroad than in his home country ( winning a gold medal in Toyama last year for example )	although his many posters for the Museo Cantonale d&#8217;Arte in Lugano or his logo for the Musee d&#8217;Orsay in Paris are very popular. &#8220;He makes pictures out of type&#8221; is a somewhat simplistic label that is attached to him, and although true, it by no means exhausts his profound talents. &#8220;If you keep shouting, you are not making communication any better. You are only removing talking and whispering from the system&#8221; he says on the first page of the small book that was published about his work in 1998. &#8220;Some posters are telegrams and some posters are poems&#8221; he explained when he noted my bewilderment with the many posters published today whose message I don&#8217;t understand. Monguzzi is a great fan of russian constructivist typography, and of El Lisitskii in particular, and anyone knowing both of them will be delighted in the quotes, variations and hommages to his idol that can be found in Monguzzi&#8217;s posters. Me, in turn, I am a longtime fan of Bruno Monguzzi, and if you ever wonderd what made me draw those heavy lines above and below the title of these pages then look at the Strawinski poster below, one of my all-time favorites.
