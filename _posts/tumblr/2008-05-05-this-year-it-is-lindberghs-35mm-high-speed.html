title: This year, it is Lindbergh’s 35mm high speed monochrome on location, as if
  it where a movie shoot. Lindbergh himself commented about this change in direction.
  ‘It was a deliberate choice,’ says Lindbergh, ‘because, when you work in colour
  what you are looking for is a sort of first-degree reality, whereas in black-and-white
  you can elaborate on that reality. You go further. I also wanted to create a relaxed
  work atmosphere for myself and my crew, with objects scattered about informally
  - a fan here, some forgotten chairs there. Only with black-and-white can one convey
  that kind of authenticity.’
