<p>Shot with the native camera app, slightly cropped with VSCOCam and then edited with Litely, Argyle High preset, and with a tad of vibrance and sharpness. I love this new app called Litely, very nice to work out sublte tones. This app is developed by a former developer of Hipstamatic, Sam Soffes and designed by the photographer Cole Rise . If you care about photos at all, give Litely a look. I think this app definitely deserves more recognition.</p>
