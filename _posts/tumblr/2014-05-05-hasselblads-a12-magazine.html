It should stop turning the moment the red/white indicator changes to all white. At this point, the number 1 will show in the film counter window. Fire and wind the camera 12 times while watching the film counter window and the red/white indicator window. Each time you fire the camera, the signal flag should change from white to red. When you wind the camera, the number in the film counter window should advance to the next number. After the 12th exposure, wind the camera and try to fire it again. It shouldn&#8217;t fire after the 12th exposure. Now remove the insert from the magazine. The number wheel should return back to number 0. Note: The newer A-12 magazines do not have a number 0. In this case, you will not see any number in the window."</p>
