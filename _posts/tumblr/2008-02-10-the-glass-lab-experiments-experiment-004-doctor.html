<p>Experiment 004 - 5:29min, 320 X 240, released 04/20/2001 Sometime around the middle of March, <a href="http://www.doctorpopular.com/">Doctor Popular</a> <img src="http://howtoyoyo.com/images/docpop.jpg" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left"/>Â sent me about two hours of raw footage and asked me to put together a video for him. You are about to see the outcome! This video has it all: See Doc in the Disco Redroom. Catch a glimpse of the elevator that leads down to the Underground Lab. Underwater yo-yoing? Underwater Solid Loop Diabolo? You bet. Plus a section to help you learn Doc&#8217;s latest and greatest tricks. This project has taken over a month of editing in the glasslab. One of the biggest challenges for me was the music since I pieced everything together for this one&#8230; the beats, the scratching, the dialog, the sound effects, etc&#8230; Hope you like it. <a href="http://www.theglasslab.com/bigvids/experiments/glasslab04.avi">DIVX</a>(59.4MB)      </p>
