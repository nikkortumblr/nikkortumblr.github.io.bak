It existed between the years of 1919 and 1933. The word Bauhaus is a translation of “Architecture House” in German. The Bauhaus art school had a large influence on various developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography. Bauhaus is generally classified by its radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality of the form itself, and the idea of mass production.
