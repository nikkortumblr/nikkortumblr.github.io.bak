</p><dl><dt>The mystery: </dt><dd> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire">Inka Empire</a> (1438–1533) had its own spoken language,   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua">Quechua</a>,   which is spoken today by about 10 million people including   a third of the Peruvian population.   It is believed that the only “written” language of the Inka   Empire is a system of different knots tied in ropes that are attached   to a longer cord.   This system is called   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu"><i>khipu</i> or <i>quipu</i></a>.   The ropes also have different colors, ply, and attachments,   providing additional mechanics for encoding information.   There is evidence from the Spanish crusades that khipus   encoded census data as well as stories.   However, no one knows how to decode either kind of information.   There are several hundred khipus in the world today, waiting to be read. </dd><dt> The challenge: </dt><dd> Our research group is trying to break the khipu code:   how did the Inkas record language with knots in rope?   By combining computation, informatics, mathematics, linguistics,   and anthropology, we hope to uncover the khipu mystery. </dd></dl>
