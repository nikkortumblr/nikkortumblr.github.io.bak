<p><img hspace="5" align="left" src="http://www.kunsthaus.ch/bilder/shop/plakate/plakat_steichen.jpg"/>11 January – 30 March 2008 The <a href="http://www.kunsthaus.ch/">Kunsthaus Zürich</a> offers a glimpse at an unknown facet of the work of the great 20th-century American photographer. Forty years after the artist’s death, original prints by Edward Steichen (1879-1973) for Vanity Fair and Vogue are only now available to the public. In the 1920s and 1930s Steichen was at the height of his career as a photographer, and some of the images he created during that period for the magazines published by Condé Nast are among his most striking. Organized by the Musée de l&#8217;Elysée, Lausanne, and the Foundation for the Exhibition of Photography, Minneapolis, in collaboration with Kunsthaus Zürich.</p>
