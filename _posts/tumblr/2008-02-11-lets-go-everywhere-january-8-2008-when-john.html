<p>When John Medeski, Chris Wood and Billy Martin go into the studio to record any new album, they re never sure what will emerge. It was no different when the trio gathered in an upstate New York studio with a few concepts, a few musical ideas and a few friends, to create Let&#8217;s Go Everywhere, the first recording designed to please their youngest fans. Amazon.com says &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go Everywhere is the kind of record that kids-music insiders get all wound up about, and for a reason that can be summed up in two tidy little words: it&#8217;s awesome.&#8221; (via <a href="http://www.mmw.net/music.jsp">MMW</a>)</p>
<p>"This is a jazzy, bluesy masterpiece from John Medeski, Billy Martin and Chris Wood. It was created for kids but will be loved by all. The whole CD is loaded with strong piano, awesome rhythms and clever lyrics. It&#8217;s impossible to listen to these songs without moving to the music."</p>
