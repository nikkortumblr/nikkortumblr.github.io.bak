<p>Most chess fans know that <b>Lothar Schmid</b> was the arbiter at the match of the century between <b>Bobby Fischer</b> and <b>Boris Spassky</b> in Reykjavik in 1972 (shown in the picture above). Lothar was deeply involved in the match being successfully concluded. After Fischer had arrived late for game one he missed game two because he insisted in playing in a closed room. Schmid agreed to this condition for game three, but the American chess genius kept adding new conditions. Spassky became terribly angry and the match was on the verge of collapse. In this situation Lothar Schmid grabbed both GMs by the shoulders and forced them into their chairs. &#8220;Now play chess!&#8221; he shouted. Spassky obediently made the first move and the match could proceed.
