<section><dialog><dt></dt><dd>"What is it?"</dd><dt></dt><dd>Fleming looked levelly at the Minister.</dd><dt></dt><dd>"It's a computer program," he said quietly.</dd><dt></dt><dd>"A computer program? Can you be sure about that?"</dd><dt></dt><dd>Fleming merely nodded. Everyone else talked.</dd><dt></dt><dd>"Please!" said Osborne, banging his fist on the table. The hubbub subsided. Mrs. Tate-Allen held up a blue-gloved hand.</dd><dt></dt><dd>"I'm afraid, Minister, some of us don't know what a computer program is."</dd><dt></dt><dd>Fleming explained, while Reinhart and Osborne sat back and breathed relief. The boy was behaving well.</dd><dt></dt><dd>"Have you tried it in a computer?" asked Mrs. Tate-Allen.</dd><dt></dt><dd>"We've used computers to break it down. We've nothing that'll take all of it." He tapped the papers in front of him.  "This is simply vast."</dd><dt></dt><dd>"If you had access to a bigger computer-" Osborne suggested.</dd><dt></dt><dd>"It isn't only size. It is, in fact, more than just a program."</dd><dt></dt><dd>"What is it then?" Vandenberg asked, settling more comfortably into his chair. It was going to be a long business.</dd><dt></dt><dd>"It's in three sections." Fleming arranged his papers as if that would make it clearer. "The first part is a design- or rather, it's a mathematical requirement which can be interpreted as a design. The second part is the program proper, the order code as we call it. The third and last part is data-information sent for the machine to work on."</dd></section></dialog>
