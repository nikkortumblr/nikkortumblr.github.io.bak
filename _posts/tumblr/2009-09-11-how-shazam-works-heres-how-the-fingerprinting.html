<p>Hereâ€™s how the fingerprinting works:<br/><br/>You can think of any piece of music as a time-frequency graph called a spectrogram..  On one axis is time, on another is frequency, and on the 3rd is intensity.  Each point on the graph represents the intensity of a given frequency at a specific point in time. Assuming time is on the x-axis and frequency is on the y-axis, a horizontal line would represent a continuous pure tone and a vertical line would represent an instantaneous burst of white noise.</p>
