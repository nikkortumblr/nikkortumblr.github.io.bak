<p>The 20th-century Italian painter <b>GIORGIO MORANDI</b> has long been a cult figure among artists; his influence can be discerned in the paintings of Philip Guston and Wayne Thiebaud, to name two. In Italy he is a cultural hero; his art appears in Federico Fellini’s “Dolce Vita.” Even so, Morandi’s reserved, nearly monochromatic still lifes of bottles and vases are not well known to a wider audience. (This famously reclusive artist, who destroyed much of his early work and granted only one interview during his lifetime, seemed to want it that way.)<br/><br/>Morandi’s international standing should change, however, when his first major survey in this country, “Giorgio Morandi, 1890-1964,” opens on Tuesday at the <b>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART</b>. The exhibition includes some 110 paintings, drawings, watercolors, and etchings, beginning with the pittura metafysica (metaphysical paintings) he produced after World War I and ending with the late, quasiabstract paintings in a muted palette that seem to prefigure Minimalism.<br/><br/>After its run at the Met “Giorgio Morandi” goes to the Museo d’Arte Moderna di Bologna, in the city where Morandi was born and where he lived and worked throughout his life.</p>
