<p>Globalive, which has recently been ramping up to launch a national Canadian phone service under the WIND brand using spectrum won in <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2008/07/22/marathon-canadian-spectrum-auction-finally-wraps-up/">last year&#8217;s auction</a>, has been dealt a hell of a blow by the CRTC this week. The organization &#8212; essentially the northern equivalent of the FCC &#8212; has strict rules demanding that Canadian wireless networks be Canadian-owned, and an investigation of WIND&#8217;s structure has apparently raised enough concern to cause it to call off the service&#8217;s launch. Egypt&#8217;s Orascom Telecom (which, strangely, also runs <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2009/08/18/north-koreans-love-their-spotty-cellphone-service/">North Korea&#8217;s Koryolink</a>) owns some 65.1 percent of the operation and apparently &#8220;holds the overwhelming majority of the outstanding debt&#8221; for which Globalive is responsible, so yeah, we can see how that might not qualify as &#8220;Canadian-owned.&#8221; For its part, Globalive says that it&#8217;s &#8220;extremely disappointed&#8221; in the decision and &#8220;will be evaluating [its] options on how to proceed,&#8221; but in all likelihood, that&#8217;s going to have to mean cashing out a good chunk of Orascom if it&#8217;s serious about making this happen.</p>
