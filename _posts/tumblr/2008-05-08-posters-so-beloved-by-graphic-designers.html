title: Posters, so beloved by graphic designers everywhere, have never felt at home
  in the United States. The European poster tradition, from Toulouse-Lautrec to Cassandre
  to Muller-Brockmann to Matthies to Troxler, has given us the profession’s defining
  icons. American posters, by contrast, have never enjoyed as confident or ubiquitous
  a street presence. Consider the memorable products of San Francisco’s psychedelic
  era, for instance, or Art Chantry’s output on behalf of the northwest music scene,
  great images but tactical moves designed for display on telephone poles or behind
  shop windows.
