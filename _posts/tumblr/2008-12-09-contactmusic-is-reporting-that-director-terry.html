The push came after he was able to secure rights from an insurance company that paid out $15 million for the movie&#8217;s troubles. Those troubles include a flash flood which destroyed several sets and an injury suffered by one of the stars which caused him to drop out. Speaking at his own tribute by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in London, Gilliam said that he now believes that God stepped in to &#8220;save his ass&#8221; on &#8220;Don Quixote&#8221; when the storm occurred. &#8220;I was in some way relieved that it did fall apart,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because I didn&#8217;t have the money to finish it. It&#8217;s a good thing it went down when it did because I would have got the blame for going over budget. I think this time we will make a better film.&#8221; The movie stars Johnny Depp, which could create some problems since Disney has recently signed him for &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean 4&#8221; and &#8220;The Lone Ranger.&#8221; Back in August Gilliam stated that &#8220;When Johnny&#8217;s ready, we&#8217;re ready. We&#8217;re just talking about dates to film. Basically it all depends on his schedule but otherwise we&#8217;re set.&#8221; (via <a href="http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=11002">Johnny Depp&#8217;s &#8220;Don Quixote&#8221; Film is Back On at WorstPreviewsâ„¢</a>)</p>
