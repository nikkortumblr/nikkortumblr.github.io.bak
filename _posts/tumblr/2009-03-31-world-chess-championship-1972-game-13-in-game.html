<p>In <b>Game 13</b>, <b>Fischer</b> avoided the Sicilian Defense, with which he had lost Game 11, instead preferring Alekhine&#8217;s Defense.[82] The game swung one way, then another, and was finally adjourned with Fischer having an edge in a sharp position but no clear win. The Soviet team&#8217;s analysis convinced them that the position was clearly drawn. Fischer stayed up until 8 a.m. the following morning analyzing it (the resumption being at 2:30 p.m.). He had not found a win either. Amazingly, he managed to set traps for <b>Spassky</b>, who fell into them and lost. Spassky&#8217;s seconds were stunned, and Spassky himself refused to leave the board for a long time after the game was over, unable to believe the result. He remarked, &#8220;It is very strange. How can one lose with the opponent&#8217;s only rook locked in completely at g8?&#8221;[83]<br/><br/>Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik said that this game made a particularly strong impression on him. He called it &#8220;the highest creative achievement of Fischer&#8221;. He resolved a drawish opposite-colored bishops endgame by sacrificing his bishop and trapping his own rook. &#8220;Then five passed pawns struggled with the white rook. Nothing similar had been seen before in chess&#8221;.[84]<br/><br/>David Bronstein said &#8220;Of all the games from the match, the 13th appeals to me most of all. When I play through the game I still cannot grasp the innermost motive behind this or that plan or even individual move. Like an enigma, it still teases my imagination.&#8221;[85]<br/><br/>Spassky-Fischer 1. e4 Nf6&#160;2. e5 Nd5&#160;3. d4 d6&#160;4. Nf3 g6&#160;5. Bc4 Nb6&#160;6. Bb3 Bg7&#160;7.
