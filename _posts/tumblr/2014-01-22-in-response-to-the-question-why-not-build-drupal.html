title: ! 'In response to the question, “Why not build Drupal the CMs as a layer on
  top of Symfony full-stack?” Larry says, “If we were starting from ground zero right
  now, there would be a viable argument to make for that. There are places where that
  might be problematic however: Symfony the full-stack framework is structurally designed
  on the assumption that all changes are code changes. Your configuration is config
  files that you edit and then deploy to production after a compile step. It’s not
  built around the ‘site-builder clicky-clicky’ model. That’s not what the full-stack
  framework is optimized for. “'
