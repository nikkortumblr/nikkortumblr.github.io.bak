<p>During the 1960s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kray_twins" title="Kray twins" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">Ronnie and Reggie Kray</a>, dominated organised crime in the East End of London, but following an extensive investigation Inspector Leonard &#8220;Nipper&#8221; Read of Scotland Yard arrested the twin brothers and sixteen members of their gang on 9th May 1968.<br/><br/>Both brothers had careers as professional boxers before turning their energies towards criminal activity. Starting out running protection rackets from a run down snooker club in Bethnal Green they were soon organising armed robberies and hijackings. The brothers invested the proceeds of these crimes in property including West End night clubs where they mixed with celebrities. They even achieved celebrity status themselves, being photographed by <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bailey_%28photographer%29" title="David Bailey (photographer)" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">David Bailey</a></b> - including the iconic image seen here.</p>
