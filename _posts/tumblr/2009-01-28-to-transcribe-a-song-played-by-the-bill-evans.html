<p>To transcribe a song played by the Bill Evans Trio, there are several things you must know in order to make life easier. 1) You must have a basic understanding of the Bill Evans style voicings, that is how he prefers to voice various chords with his left hand. This will help you greatly in figuring out what chords he is trying to use, or how he is voicing those chords. Here are a few examples found in this song. - you will find a lot of minor 9th chord in my transcription. This is when Bill is using his 3,7,9 voicings. Where a Dm9 chord will be voiced with a F, C and E.. starting from the lower. - you will also find a few 7(add6) chord. This is when Bill is using is 7,3,6 voicings. Where a G7(add6) will be voiced with F,B and E, also starting from the lower. 2) Bill Evans bassist is one who is famous for NOT play the root of the chord, and sometimes even soloing together with Bill. For example. -in bar 13 of my transcription, although its notated as an Am9, but the bassist was actually stopping on a G note, but considering the whole context of the song, an Am chord would make much more sense. See for it yourself. -in bar 12, the bassist was actually playing a line at the same time Bill was doing his. So considering the notes of the bass line, Bill’s lines and also his left hand comping, I came to the conclusion of notating it as a Gm7 with a flatted fifth. There are also times when I wrote a C13(omit11) kinda thing. That’s when Bill was playing a Bflat, D and A in his left hand instead of his usual voicing of Bflat, E and A for a typical C chord when functioning as a dominant. The Aalt chord you will find in the transcription is actually when Bill is playing the A7 chord with a raised 5th and raised 9th.</p>
