(via <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/arts/cartier_bresson_2960.jsp">The People of Russia, Henri Cartier-Bresson | openDemocracy</a>)</p><p>This  image is a spread from Henri Cartier-Bresson’s “The People of Russia”, originally published in Paris Match (France)in 1955. The image is taken from “Things As They Are&#160;: Photojournalism in Context since 1955”, which tells the story of reportage photography from the heyday of Life magazine to the era of the camera-phone in the present day. </p>
