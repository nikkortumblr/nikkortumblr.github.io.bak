He is perhaps best known for his book The Art of Typography and the typographical logos he designed for Hyundai, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, Fisher Price, and Volvo Automobiles, which are recognized worldwide. A wonderful quote from Solomon himself: &#8220;Drawing letters is synonymous with studying the fine arts. It is a disciplined art because of its exactness, yet within its rigorous requirements, it reveals the free flow of mystical lines.&#8221;</p><p>"Typo-icon-ography" is Solomon&#8217;s term for the art of typography, an art he finds comparable to painting, music, or dance in its symbolic and artistic value. The form of this well-illustrated book reflects his view that "drawing letters is synonymous with studying the fine arts. It is a disciplined art because of its exactness, yet within its rigorous requirements, it reveals the free flow of mystical lines." Part 1 discusses the elements and principles of typographic layout and design in aesthetic terms, while the remaining sections specifically relate to refinements of working with type, e.g., terminology, measurements, spacing, paper. Suggested assignments, including creating urban signs, playing cards, and photo essays, illustrate the visual principles Solomon discusses.Â </p>
