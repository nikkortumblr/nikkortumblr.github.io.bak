<p>World-War-II-era diagram of the town of Hanford, Washington. Hanford was one of two U.S. cities selected to house processes integral to the development of the atomic bomb. Hanford, which was chosen for its 500,000 acres of isolated land bordering the Columbia River, was the site of the development of the new element plutonium.</p>
