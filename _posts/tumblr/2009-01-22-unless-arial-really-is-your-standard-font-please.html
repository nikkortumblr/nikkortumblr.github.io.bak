<img src="/tumblr_files/069MD6LsDj1ixlf3Phx35Mf9o1_400.gif"/><br/><p>Unless Arial really is your standard font, please use the order helvetica, arial in your CSS font declarations, not the popular arial, helvetica. Why? Because Arial, formerly Sonoran Sans Serif, basically still means kind of a copy of Helvetica, and Helvetica is ubiquitous or popular enough so that one can actually reference it; in fact, it’s even one of the Mac OS system fonts.
