Effective layout is essential to communication and enables the end user to not only be drawn in with an innovative design but to digest information easily.<br/><br/>Making and Breaking the Grid is a comprehensive layout design workshop that assumes that in order to effectively break the rules of grid-based design, one must first understand those rules and see them applies to real-world projects. <br/><br/>Text reveals top designers’ work in process and rationale. Projects with similar characteristics are linked through a simple notational system that encourages exploration and comparison of structure ideas.
