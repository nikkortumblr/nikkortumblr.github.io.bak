<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_f/64">Group f/64</a> was a group of photographers espousing a common philosophy. The group was created in 1932 and was the idea of members Willard Van Dyke with his friend Preston Holder . The membership is often listed in this broad way:</p><ul><li>Ansel Adams<br/></li><li>Imogen Cunningham<br/></li><li>Willard Van Dyke<br/></li><li>John Paul Edwards<br/></li><li>Consuelo Kanaga<br/></li><li>Alma Lavenson<br/></li><li>Preston Holder<br/></li><li>Sonia Noskowiak<br/></li><li>Henry Swift<br/></li><li>Edward Weston<br/></li></ul>The term f/64 refers to the smallest aperture setting on a large format camera, which secures maximum depth of field, rendering a photograph evenly sharp from foreground to background. Such a small aperture sometimes implies a long exposure and therefore a selection of relatively slow moving or motionless subject matter, such as landscapes and still life, but in the typically bright California light this is less a factor in the subject matter chosen than the sheer size and clumsiness of the cameras, compared to the smaller cameras increasingly used in action and reportage photography in the 1930s.
