<p>LEF (&#8220;ЛЕФ&#8221;) was the journal of the Left Front of the Arts (&#8220;Levyi Front Iskusstv&#8221; - &#8220;Левый фронт искусств&#8221;), a widely ranging association of avant-garde writers, photographers, critics and designers in the Soviet Union. It had two runs, one from 1923 to 1925 as LEF, and later from 1927 to 1929 as Novyi LEF (&#8216;New LEF&#8217;). The journal&#8217;s objective, as set out in one of its first issues, was to &#8220;re-examine the ideology and practices of so-called leftist art, and to abandon individualism to increase art&#8217;s value for developing communism.&#8221;</p>
