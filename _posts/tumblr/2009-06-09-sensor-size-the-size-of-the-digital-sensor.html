<p>The size of the digital sensor element (which is equivalent to the size of the negative for film cameras) is pretty small in all consumer digicams - typically around the size of a fingernail (and a small fingernail at that!). As I said above, a 35mm film frame is 24mm high by 36mm wide but most digital cameras use sensors very much smaller than this. Here are some typical digicam sensor sizes. The &#8220;name&#8221; of the sensor is based on specification for old TV tubes used in the 1950s. Nobody is quite sure why it&#8217;s being used for modern digital sensors since the &#8220;sizes&#8221; don&#8217;t really relate in any consistent way to the actual physical size of the sensor. However these names are widely used, so it&#8217;s best to know what they are. They are often listed in digital camera spec sheets.</p>
