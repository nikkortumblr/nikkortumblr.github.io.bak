title: 21/8 is not that hard actually, because it’s three times seven. The difficult
  part of the suite [“Music for Three-Piece-Orchestra,” Spiral], is in 19/8. It’s
  a groove of 4, 5, 4, 6, and I just played it until I got it. I really like the sound
  and I didn’t think, “I want to write in 19/8.” I was just playing and I got the
  riff from somewhere. And of course, in the beginning, I couldn’t even play it. [Laughs.]
  I played until I felt comfortable with it. I played with it until I could play it
  as if I was playing 4/4.
