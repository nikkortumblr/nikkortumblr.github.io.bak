Born in 1914, he studied architecture, design and history of art and in 1936 opened his own studio in Zurich, specialising in graphics, exhibition design and photography. Müller-Brockmann was a true master and rare pioneer of his craft, and even after his death in 1996, his work still sets a benchmark for others in his profession. </p><p>via <a href="http://www.blanka.co.uk/i/products/813.jpg">www.blanka.co.uk</a></p>
