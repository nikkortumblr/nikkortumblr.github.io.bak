<p>"The fact is that the onrush of change has become so drastic that people are utterly confused as to what the situation actually is, what may eventuate from it, what they want instead and what needs to be done. And while the very essence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society" title="Society" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">human society</a> is being transformed, the economic and technical glamour of its achievements conceals from our sight that these unceasing waves of change attack the very roots of our individual and collective life. We thus fail to see the danger element inherent in uncontrolled growth. Phenomenal increases, rapidly approaching critical maxima, are happening in population, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution" title="Pollution" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">pollution</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" title="Energy" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">energy</a> release, speed, automation and other areas revolutionized by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology" title="Technology" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">technology</a>.Â  In the changed dynamics of these interacting factors lie the reasons why mankind is confronted with such an unprecedented complex of explosive problems. But we do not yet seem ready to realize that the time has come to plan and act on a scale and in ways capable of matching the new thrust and threat of events. Considering the situation in these broad and essential terms, We must recognize that very little is being done to redress it and set human fortunes on a sound and reasonable course very bleak situations will undoubtedly meet us during the next decades, unless a supreme effort is made now to get out of the present global impasse.&#8221;</p>
