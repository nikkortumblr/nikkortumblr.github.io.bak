Though Miles was a classical music fan, the resulting 500+ sleeves that he designed for the label (up to 1967) oerfectly captured the hip, modern and distinctive style of the music inside. Along with partner Francis Wolff (who&#8217;s striking photographs featured on most sleeves) and Fred Lion (the blue note studio engineer) Miles created the quintessentially cool package that was Blue Note.<br/><br/>Reid Miles undestood photography and its potentil for impact. His cover design for Blue Note made maximum use of Wolff&#8217;s images, accentuating them with close crops and duotoning and covering the whole 12*12&#8221;. He often relegated the artist name and album title to the margins of the design with simple, functional yet elegant typography. When Miles believed that Wolff&#8217;s images weren&#8217;t impactful enough alone (or he had better design idea) he would use dramatic typography, often inspired by the album title combined with other graphic figures such as lines, spots, bars, brush strokes. It was Wolff&#8217;s photography that took the backseat at these times, being cropped, scaled to thumbnai size or manipulated with lenses (he didn&#8217;t have photoshop).</p>
