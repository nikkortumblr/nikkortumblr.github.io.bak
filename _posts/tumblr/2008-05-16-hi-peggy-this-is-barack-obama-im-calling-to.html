title: Hi Peggy. This is Barack Obama. I’m calling to apologize on two fronts. One
  was you didn’t get your question answered and I apologize. I thought that we had
  set up interviews with all the local stations. I guess we got it with your station
  but you weren’t the reporter that got the interview. And so, I broke my word. I
  apologize for that and I will make up for it. Second apology is for using the word
  ‘sweetie.’ That’s a bad habit of mine. I do it sometimes with all kinds of people.
  I mean no disrespect and so I am duly chastened on that front. Feel free to call
  me back. I expect that my press team will be happy to try to make it up to you whenever
  we are in Detroit next.
