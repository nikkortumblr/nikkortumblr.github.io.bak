<p>Shot with the default camera app with 1:1 ratio. Processed with VSCOcam with t2 preset. No additional processing. I always used hipstamatic, but now i’m switching to vscocam to achieve a simple and natural look. Just concentrating on light and composition. These are not planned photographs but simply snapshots of things/mood/lights that attract my attention. And i simply try to capture this particular mood i’m seeing.
