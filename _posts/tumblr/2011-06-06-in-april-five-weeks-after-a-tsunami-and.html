<p>In April, five weeks after a tsunami and earthquake damaged the Fukushima nuclear power plant, the Japanese authorities raised the upper level limit of acceptable radiation from 1&#160;mSv per year to 20&#160;mSv per year for school children.
It is hard to believe that the current Japanese government is falling so far behind the 5&#160;mSv standard set by the Soviets. How can a government that lived with the fallout of nuclear bombs allow such high levels of radiation exposure for its children? Why is the Japanese government not actively decontaminating school grounds?</p>
