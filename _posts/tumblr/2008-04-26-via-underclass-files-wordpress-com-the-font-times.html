It has also inspired others including Georgia which has a wider serif.<br/><br/>Times New Roman has been re-designed from old-style characteristics and adapted to give better legibility for its main use in books and magazines, for reports, office documents and also for display and advertising.<br/><br/>The name Roman indicates authority and robustness and the shape of the serif and cross stroking coupled with the decorative stroke of the font relates back to Roman plinths and temples, itâ€™s no wonder the U.S. State department has decided to stamp its authority with a size 14 Times New Roman font on all of its diplomatic documents.</p>
