title: Exposure value (EV) strictly speaking has nothing to do with any light level,
  it is simply a number and a shorthand way of expressing the fact that going one
  shutter speed faster and one aperture larger (or vice-versa) gives the same exposure.
  EV 14, for example, is ALWAYS 1/125 @ f11 (or 1/60 @ f16, or 1/250 @ f8, etc.).
