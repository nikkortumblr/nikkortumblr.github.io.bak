These have the look of cartoon creatures, or characters from Greek mythology. Drawing is integral to his work. He uses a very limited palette, which has the effect of highlighting his fascination with line and form. ‘I use paint just to fill in the drawing,’ he has said. Blu sees buildings as ‘sheets of paper’ to sketch on. Due to their massive scale, his works often give the impression that the buildings they’re painted on aren’t quite big enough. What is unique about his work is his ability to doodle in a seemingly casual way on an epic scale. In terms of production, the work happens in two stages: first, he draws images in his sketch book but when he comes to working on the walls he often improvises something completely new. His influences include underground and independent comic-book artists such as Robert Crumb, but he is also inspired by the fresco tradition of his native Italy and though it is quite removed from his practice, by the work of Gordon Matta-Clark. As Blu puts it: ‘The way Matta-Clark used the building as a sculpture; it’s something I try to imitate when I paint.’ <a href="http://www.blublu.org">www.blublu.org</a> (via <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/street-art/street-art-artists">Street Art, artists | Tate</a>)</p>
