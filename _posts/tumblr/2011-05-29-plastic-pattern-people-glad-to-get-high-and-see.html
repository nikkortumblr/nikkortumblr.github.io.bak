<p><a href="http://www.themusic-world.info/artist/gil_scott-heron/lyrics/plastic_pattern_people">Plastic Pattern People</a><br/></p><blockquote>Glad to get high and see the slow motion world.<br/>Just to reach, and touch, the half notes floating.<br/>Worlds spinning orbit quicker than 9/8ths Dave Brubeck.<br/>We come now, frantically searching for Thomas Moore, rainbow villages.<br/>Up on suddenly, Charlie Mingus and our man Abdul Malik,<br/>to add bass, to a bottomless pit of insecurity.<br/><br/>You may be plastic because you never meditate,<br/>about the bottom of glasses, The third side of your universe.<br/><br/>Add on Alice Coltrane and her cosmic strains.<br/>Still no vocal on blue black horizons.<br/><br/>Your plasticity is tested by a formless assault.<br/>The sun can answer questions in tune, to all your sacrifices.<br/>But why would our new jazz age give us no more mind expanding puzzles?<br/><br/>Enter John.<br/><br/>Blow from under, always, and never, so that the morning, the sun,<br/>may scream of brain bending saxophones.<br/><br/>The third world arrives, with Yusef Lateef, and Pharaoh Saunders.<br/>With oboes straining to touch the core of your unknown soul.<br/>Ravi Shankar comes, with strings attached, prepared to stabilize your seventh sense,<br/>Your black rhythm.<br/><br/>Up and down a silly ladder run the notes, without the words.<br/>Words are important for the mind, but the notes are for the soul.<br/>Miles Davis, So what?<br/>Cannonball, Fiddler, Mercy.<br/>Dexter Gordon, One Flight Up.<br/>Donald Byrd, playing Cristo, but what about words?<br/><br/>Would you like to survive on sadness? Call on Ella and Jose Happiness.<br/>Drift with Smokey, Bill Medley, Bobby Taylor, and Otis Redding. <br/>Soul music where frustrations are washed by drums, Nina and Miriam.<br/><br/>Congo, Mongo, Beat me, senseless, bongo, Tonto.<br/>Flash through dream worlds of STP and LSD. <br/>Speed kills and sometimes musics call, is frustrated.<br/>And the black man is confused.<br/><br/>Our speed is our life pace, much too fast, not good.<br/>I beg you to escape, and live, and hear all of the real.<br/>Until a call comes for you to cry elsewhere.<br/>We must all cry, but tell me.<br/><br/>Must our tears be white?</blockquote>
