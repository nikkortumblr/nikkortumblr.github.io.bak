The term is also used for an associated traditional dance style.<br/><br/>Music is an important part of most public events in traditional New Orleans culture. Processions with music include the periodic parades of benevolent societies, social aid &amp; pleasure clubs, such as Zulu, other Carnival krewes, and of course the famous funerals with music, often called &#8220;jazz funerals&#8221;.<br/><br/>The &#8220;first line&#8221; of a funeral consisted of the people who were an integral part of the ceremony, such as the members of the club or krewe, or family and friends of the deceased. Usually brightly coloured items such as beads and feathers were offered to the &#8220;second line&#8221;. The &#8220;second line&#8221; originally referred to people who were attracted to the music. Traditionally such people would follow behind the &#8220;first line.&#8221; (In the final decades of the 20th century it became more common for some such onlookers who joined the procession to mix in or even get ahead of the band and first line, behavior considered a social faux pas by older New Orleanians.)</p>
