Taking on a more experi-mental approach to typography, the Dadaists and Futurists in the 1920s and 1930s, and later Concrete Poetry during 1950s and 1960s experimented with floating type compositions and fragmented typographic treatments, releasing type from its linear structure. Further developments of the deconstructivist typography in the 1990&#8217;s shifted the typographic practice towards a spatial, non-linear process: &#8216;Communication for the deconstructivist is no longer linear, but involves in-stead the provision of many entry and exit points for the increasingly over-stimulated reader.&#8217; [Cahalan 1994, p.1] The page is no longer to be just &#8220;read&#8221; but also &#8220;perceived&#8221;, beyond the pure textual content, into all of its associative conjunctions: We are meant to &#8220;feel&#8221; rather than &#8220;read&#8221; a page. The end of the century, with the rising issues surrounding global economies, ecology and rising poverty in developing countries was a time when graphic designers took a long, hard look at the nature of their work; at its ephemereal qualities, its associations with consumerism/capitalism. The outcome took into account unexpected resources; the ordinary, the often-used, the soon to be discarded - as indeed is most of the output of graphic design itself. Designers sought inspiration in unlikely items such as old ticket stubs, torn billboards and discarded packages and the expression and legitimisation of the vernacular.
