Rosetta’s Philae lander successfully touched down on the comet’s surface, a cosmic first, on Nov. 12. Philae spent more than two days conducting experiments before its solar-powered battery ran out of juice. The images here were taken by Rosetta and Philae before and after the comet landing. They depict a previously unexplored part of the universe, the true revelations from which are yet to be revealed.
