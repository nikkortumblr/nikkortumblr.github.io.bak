title: Some studies have suggested a significant correlation between creativity and
  bipolar disorder. Though studies consistently show a positive correlation between
  the two, the exact nature of the relationship between the disorder and creativity
  is still unclear. One study indicated increased striving for and attainment of goals
  and achievements was correlated with onset of manic symptoms.[6] While the disorder
  affects people differently, individuals with bipolar disorder tend to be much more
  outgoing and daring than individuals without bipolar disorder. The disorder is also
  found in a large number of people involved in the arts. It is an ongoing study as
  to why many creative geniuses had bipolar disorder.
