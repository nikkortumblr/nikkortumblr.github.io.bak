It&#8217;s how you use &#8216;em that counts. In the spirit of the first Cool Type, this book offers an international look at how cutting-edge typefaces are used in actual designs. Cool Type 2wo features the latest free-thinking work from an all-new roster of 44 top designers. You&#8217;ll see fonts that speak for themselves, whether in whispers, chuckles or screams &#8230; some that blow you away and others that rub you the wrong way. (Hey, that&#8217;s what happens on the cutting edge!) Complete with insights on how the typefaces were created or manipulated, Cool Type 2wo is guaranteed to alter&#8212;or at least seriously challenge&#8212;the way you use type. <br/><br/>Spencer Drate is a noted graphic designer and consultant specializing in CD packaging graphics. He has created award-winning designs for many popular recording artists including Lou Reed, the Beach Boys, U2, the Velvet Underground, Bob Marley and the Talking Heads. He is also the author of Designing for Music (PBC International, 1993, reissued in paperback as Rock Art). Jtka Salavetz has freelanced for Justdesign for more than twelve years and has co-designed most of the packaging with Spencer Drate. They live in New York, New York.</p>
