<img src="/tumblr_files/069MD6LsDdifmi6w3lTQsdsl_500.png"/><br/><p><b>Canon</b> has just added a mysterious teaser to its US website. The page shows a silhouette of a camera with the words &#8216;Destined Evolution.&#8217; Maybe it will be updated to include more detail in the future, we don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s almost as if the company is building up to the launch of a camera to replace one of its older models. We have no specific information but it doesn&#8217;t require any profound market insight to <b>predict an EOS 5D replacement is coming &#8230;</b></p>
