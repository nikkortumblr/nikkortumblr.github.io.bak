Clarke&#8217;s 2001: A Space Oddysey, SAL 9000 was, like her &#8216;brother&#8217;, a supercomputer designed by Dr. Chandra for use as a reference system for HAL With her gleaming blue &#8216;eye&#8217; and her sultry, Indian accented voice SAL was a far more comforting character than HAL for one reason above all others. She never asphyxiated anyone and bunged &#8216;em out an airlock. That kind of thing will really put a crimp on your day after all and she frankly wasn&#8217;t that kind of computer. She was nice. If she&#8217;d have done anything she would&#8217;ve let poor Dave Bowman back in whilst looking at HAL with a kind of &#8216;I&#8217;m not angry HAL, just disappointed&#8217; look whilst HAL looked at his feet and shuffled about mumbling something about being &#8216;sorry&#8217; and that he&#8217;d try to re-connect Frank Poole&#8217;s oxygen pipe&#8230;<br/>So there you have it. HAL 9000 - Evil. SAL 9000 - Nice.<br/><br/>The cosmic balance is restored.</p>
