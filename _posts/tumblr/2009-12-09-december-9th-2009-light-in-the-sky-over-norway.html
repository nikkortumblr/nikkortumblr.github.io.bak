<p>Apparently, this is not a Photoshopped image, as there are several more just like it, taken from various locations. This morning in northern Norway, people saw a strange light in the sky which shocked residents and so far, the phenomenon has yet to be explained. This picture was taken from a pier, looking to the east, approximately at 07.50 am local time. &#8220;I can imagine that it went on for two, three minutes,&#8221; said the photographer Jan Petter Jørgensen. &#8220;It was unbelievable. I was quite shaken when I saw it.&#8221;</p>
