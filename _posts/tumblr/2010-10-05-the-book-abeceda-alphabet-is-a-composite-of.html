<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_l9s0a8Ee5N1qz8s2x.jpg"/><br/><p>The book <strong>Abeceda</strong> (Alphabet) is a composite of experimental poetry, modern dance, graphic  design and photomontaged typography, based on a poem by VitÄ•zslav  Nezval in the order of the letters of the Latin alphabet. Each double  page features a set of quatrains facing a sometimes abstracted letter  composed of typographic elements and a photograph of the dancer Milca  Mayerova.</p>
