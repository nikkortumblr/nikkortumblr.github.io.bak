Her latest book, An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar, took four years to assemble as the photographer gained access to research facilities and government offices hidden from the public. ‘I felt like I was discovering a new landscape in America, a new terrain, morally and politically,’ she said.</b>  <p><b>The book dives under the surface of society with images of decomposing bodies and radioactive waste, deadly viruses and an outdoor recreation area for death-row inmates. The result is an all-access pass into America’s best-kept secrets.”</b></p> </blockquote>  <b>This image is the 2nd of a series of eleven.  This photo got my attention right away because of the eerie but beautiful blue glow. There’s a good reason for the blue light emitted by what look like dots.:</b>  <blockquote> <u><b>CHERENKOV RADIATION, NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE FACILITY</b></u> <p>  <b>“Submerged in a pool of water, these stainless-steel nuclear-waste capsules contain radioactive material. The water serves as a shield against the radiation emitted. Nearly 2,000 capsules reside at the Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State, which is considered among the most contaminated waste sites in the United States.  </b></p><p>‘Radiation is a light source I’ve never worked with, so there was no visual reference to shoot (the images) from — it was a leap of faith,’ Simon said. ‘I found this one section that resembled the U.S. That was a great find.’ The blue glow comes from an effect called Cherenkov radiation.”</p> </blockquote>  <b>Clicking the photo will take you to the first image of the slideshow. </b>   </blockquote>
