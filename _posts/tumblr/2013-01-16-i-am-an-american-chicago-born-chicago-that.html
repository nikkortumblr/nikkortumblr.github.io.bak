title: 'I am an American, Chicago born—Chicago, that somber city—and go at things
  as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first
  to knock, first admitted; sometimes an innocent knock, sometimes a not so innocent.
  But a man’s character is his fate, says Heraclitus, and in the end there isn’t any
  way to disguise the nature of the knocks by acoustical work on the door or gloving
  the knuckles.'
