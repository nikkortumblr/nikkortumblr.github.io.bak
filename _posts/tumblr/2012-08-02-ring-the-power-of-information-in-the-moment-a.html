<p>RING â€“ THE POWER OF INFORMATION <br/>
In the moment a bird gets a ring on its leg, it carries information on its ID at the same time, i.e. on its sex, age, date and place of ringing, etc. The easiest way to mark young White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) is to ring them at their nests when still unable to fly. Slovenian rings carry the inscription LJUBLJANA SLOVENIJA and a serial number, e.g. ZT 43. <br/>
In the autumn 2007, an e-mail was sent to us by a Belgian tourist from the Republic of South Africa, telling us that he had identified a Slovenian ring on the leg of a White Stork. In our Museum, we promptly processed the data on the bird&#8217;s ringing and recovery and sent them to the Republic of South Africa. Among other things, we were able to conclude that the air distance between the place of ringing in Slovenia and the place of recovery in the South African Republic was 7,814&#160;km.</p>
