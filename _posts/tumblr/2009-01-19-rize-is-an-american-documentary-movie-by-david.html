<p><b>Rize</b> is an American documentary movie by <b>David</b> <b>LaChapelle</b>, released in January 2005. Rize is a documentary which follows an interview schedule of two related dancing sub-cultures of Los Angeles: clowning and krumping. The first series of interviews develop the idea of clowning, the second series the idea of krumping, the third section of the film depicts a dance battle between clowns and krumpers. An atypical sequence in the film uses montage to compare 1840s era anthropological films of African dance ritual with contemporary clowning and krumping dance maneuvers.</p>
