<p class="Normal">CRUCIFIX IN CLASSROOMS:</p>
<p class="Normal">CONTRARY TO PARENTS’ RIGHT TO  EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN IN LINE WITH THEIR CONVICTIONS AND TO CHILDREN’S  RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION</p>
<p class="Normal">Violation of Article 2 of Protocol  No. 1 (right to education)</p>
<p class="Normal">examined jointly  with Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion)  <br/> of the European Convention on  Human Rights</p>
<p class="Normal">Decision of the Court</p>
<p class="Normal">The presence of the crucifix – which it was impossible  not to notice in the classrooms – could easily be interpreted by pupils  of all ages as a religious sign and they would feel that they were being  educated in a school environment bearing the stamp of a given religion.  This could be encouraging for religious pupils, but also disturbing  for pupils who practised other religions or were atheists, particularly  if they belonged to religious minorities. The freedom not to believe  in any religion (inherent in the freedom of religion guaranteed by the  Convention) was not limited to the absence of religious services or  religious education: it extended to practices and symbols which expressed  a belief, a religion or atheism. This freedom deserved particular protection  if it was the State which expressed a belief and the individual was  placed in a situation which he or she could not avoid, or could do so  only through a disproportionate effort and sacrifice.</p>
<p class="Normal">The State was to refrain from imposing beliefs in  premises where individuals were dependent on it. In particular, it was  required to observe confessional neutrality in the context of public  education, where attending classes was compulsory irrespective of religion,  and where the aim should be to foster critical thinking in pupils.</p>
<p class="Normal">The Court was unable to grasp how the display, in  classrooms in State schools, of a symbol that could reasonably be associated  with Catholicism (the majority religion in Italy) could serve the educational  pluralism that was essential to the preservation of a “democratic  society” as that was conceived by the Convention, a pluralism that  was recognised by the Italian Constitutional Court.</p>
<p class="Normal">The compulsory display of a symbol of a given confession  in premises used by the public  authorities, and especially in  classrooms, thus restricted the right of parents to educate their children  in conformity with their convictions, and the right of children to believe  or not to believe. The Court concluded, unanimously, that there had  been a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 taken jointly with Article  9 of the Convention.</p>
